                                <p>My thesis maps the complex digital infrastructure supporting free casual game apps on Android, aiming to demystify this complexity for users. By studying key players and their relationships, the research highlights a need for a user-friendly narrative, as users are often excluded by technical jargon meant for experts. "Invisible Trails" offers an alternative narrative to the typical app download experience, providing a space for discussion, awareness, and action. This project combines adversarial design and digital literacy to develop an educational tool that enhances users awareness, empowering them to make informed decisions.

This opaque ecosystem conceals multiple actors, preventing users from fully understanding the system. Trackers, which are third-party tools integrated into games, address economic and functional needs by simplifying development. They operate by collecting data and remain hidden from users, seamlessly blending into the game once integrated.

To narrow down the scope, I chose to focus on the top 100 freemium casual game apps available on the Google Play Store.

The title, "Invisible Trails," plays on the dual meaning of "trail," highlighting the core aspects of the project: the data users leave behind while gaming as digital traces and the journey these data undertake. The subtitle clarifies the project's purpose and theme, making its intentions clear.

                                      “The collection” section allows users to select a specific application and reseamble an app store to create a parallel experience able to inform the users about what they are actually downloading.

                                     Each app's page follows the same structure, organized into sequential tabs. Here the travel metaphor serves a dual purpose: firstly, expressing the paradox that while we are “still” playing, our data travels worldwide; secondly, it helps to concretize a theme often perceived as abstract.
