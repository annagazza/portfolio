Exposing the hidden infrastructure behind apps through data storytelling
 </p>
                                <p>My thesis maps the complex digital infrastructure supporting free casual game apps on Android, aiming to demystify this complexity for users. By studying key players and their relationships, the research highlights a need for a user-friendly narrative, as users are often excluded by technical jargon meant for experts. "Invisible Trails" offers an alternative narrative to the typical app download experience, providing a space for discussion, awareness, and action. This project combines adversarial design and digital literacy to develop an educational tool that enhances users awareness, empowering them to make informed decisions.

This opaque ecosystem conceals multiple actors, preventing users from fully understanding the system. Trackers, which are third-party tools integrated into games, address economic and functional needs by simplifying development. They operate by collecting data and remain hidden from users, seamlessly blending into the game once integrated.

To narrow down the scope, I chose to focus on the top 100 freemium casual game apps available on the Google Play Store.

                                                <p>Despite their popularity, players often interact with apps without seeing the underlying data-driven infrastructure.
